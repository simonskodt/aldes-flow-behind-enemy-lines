# Flow Behind Enemy Lines

Mandatory assignment in Algorithm Design using Flow Networks.

## Task

To find the maximum flow and corresponding minimum cut in a flow network, 
describing the railway system of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.

## Motivation

> Weâ€™re behind on the five year plan! The party secretary from Minsk has been 
tasked with reducing the capacity of one or two railway lines by 10 or 20 
kilotons per day. Luckily, you have acquired data about the full Soviet railway 
system from an American double agent.

## Input and Output

From the input-file `data/rail.txt`, we must run the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm 
to achieve the output provided in the `data/result.txt`.
